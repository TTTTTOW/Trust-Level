## Description:
Using R, Python and orange to create a predictive model to classify the scans as fraudulent or non-fraudulent. The classification does not consider whether the fraud was committed intentionally or inadvertently.

## Scenario:
An established food retailer (Foodland) has introduced a self-scanning system that allows customers to scan their items using a handheld mobile scanner while shopping. However, this type of payment leaves the retailer open to the risk that a certain number of customers will take advantage of this freedom to commit fraud by not scanning all of the items in their cart.
